Hi! I'm a PhD student with [Prof. J\"urgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) at The Swiss AI Lab ([IDSIA](https://www.idsia.ch/)). 
I'm broadly interested in the areas of unsupervised learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. 
My long-term goal is to allow machines to understand, reason and draw inferences about the physical world with human-level efficiency and generalization capacities. 
Towards this end, my current research revolves around developing unsupervised representation learning methods with a focus on symbol-like abstractions such as objects, events, skills etc.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
