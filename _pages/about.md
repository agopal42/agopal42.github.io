Hi! I'm a PhD student with [Prof. JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) at The Swiss AI Lab ([IDSIA](https://www.idsia.ch/)).
I'm broadly interested in the areas of unsupervised learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. \
My long-term goal is to allow machines to understand, reason and draw inferences about the physical world \ 
with human-level efficiency and generalization capacities. Towards this end, my current research revolves \
around developing unsupervised representation learning methods with a focus on symbol-like abstractions \
such as objects, events, skills etc. \
