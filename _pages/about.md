Hi! I'm a PhD student with [Prof. JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) at The Swiss AI Lab ([IDSIA](https://www.idsia.ch/)). I'm broadly interested in the areas of unsupervised learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.
My long-term goal is to allow machines to understand, reason and draw inferences about the physical world with human-level efficiency and generalization capacities. Towards this end, my current research revolves around developing unsupervised representation learning methods with a focus on symbol-like abstractions such as objects, events, skills etc.

Before this, I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University. My master's thesis was on generative modelling of human motion, which I pursued with the guidance of [Prof. C. Lee Giles](http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). In my undergraduate days, I was interested in signal processing specifically on the domains of images and speech.
